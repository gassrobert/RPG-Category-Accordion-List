# Category Accordion List WordPress Widget

I created The Category Accordion List WordPress Widget, because I was unsatisfied with the way the standard WordPress category widget looked.

Rather than just displaying categories and subcategories in a list, it displays them in an accordion with the subcategories hidden beneath.

Just choose whether to display the number of posts for each category and save it in the admin widget area and it will display in whatever widget area that it's placed in.
